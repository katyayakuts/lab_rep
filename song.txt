Hello, it's nice to meet you! Can you tell me where I am?
I don't know how I got here but I, I think I'm starting to understand
I don't belong among the angels, and baby that's just fine with me
The things I did up there were high school, but now I'm going for my degree

Hey! Sorry but you just got in my way
I promise honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit, does that make me insane?
Haven't been the same since I expired
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire!

Wait a minute, do I know you?
Weren't you an old pal of mine?
Departed from us far too early,
but now we're meeting a second time
We used to have such fun together,
and maybe you have what I need
But first I have one tiny question,
tell me: do you demons bleed?

Hey! Sorry but you just got in my way
I promise honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit, does that make me insane?
Haven't been the same since I expired
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire!
